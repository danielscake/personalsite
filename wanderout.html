                        <p>
                            In January of 2017 I received an assignment to design a brand, website and app for another team who had developed a product called WanderOut. Their product is a specialized company that focuses on developing outdoor products. WanderOut is the company’s first released product: a travel sized cylindrical device that combines 7 essential outdoor tools into one compact device.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The primary objective of the WanderOut is to give people the tools they need to explore effortlessly. WanderOut promotes feelings of security by making clients feel like there is always a way for someone to be looking out for them via the GPS tracking system. The secondary objective that WanderOut wants to achieve is the promotion of a safe and reliable product, on behalf of a valued and trustworthy company.

                        <img src="assets/persona.png" class="about-image" alt="persona for users">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="pad">
                    <p2>
                        After having a meeting with the team to discuss their other goals, our team set out to design personas and a possible website architecture.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Our team decided that building the website architecture would allow us to show the team an idea of the customer path in our second meeting.
                </p>
                <div class="pad">
                    <h1>Website <span class="greentext">Architecture</span></h1>
                </div>

                <p>Next we designed a website architecture. I found this to be a very important step in the process. It helped our team with several things. The first was to map out the website and understand how a user would experience it. The second was that it gave us a framework for moving forward. Lastly it allowed the other team to experience the flow in an easily changeable way. </p>

                <p>This was my first foray into designing website architecture — it may not fit the “standards.” We used different shapes to signify different things. The rounded rectangles are buttons, ellipses are pages, diamonds are inputs, etc.</p>
                <img src="assets/web-arch.png" class="about-image" alt="WanderOut Website Architecture">

                <div class="pad">
                    <h1>Design <span class="greentext">Considerations</span></h1>
                </div>

                <p>The next week was filled with designing. I started my process by getting a look at different images that have to do with hiking and the outdoors. I received different feeling from this but I saw greens, browns, and the overall feeling of beauty and warmth.</p>

                <img src="assets/color-palettes.png" class="about-image" alt="WanderOut Color Palettes">

                <div class="pad">
                    <p>The last step before logo ideation was font considerations.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="assets/font-considerations.png" class="about-image" alt="WanderOut Font Considerations">
                <div class="pad">
                    <p>My first thought was to focus on the two seperate words and work with W and O. Later I tried adding the full words.</p>
                </div>
                <img src="assets/Logo-1.png" class="about-image" alt="WanderOut Logo 1">
                <img src="assets/Logo-2.png" class="about-image" alt="WanderOut Logo 2">
                <div class="pad">
                    <p>My rationale for these designs was simple. This tool is used for hiking. I therefore felt that it would be important to include symbols that are common in hiking. In my head I imagined what kind of a logo I would want. I saw tents, compasses, mountains and trees. This is the outcome of that.</p>
                </div>
                <p> WanderOut ended up requestioning a mix of some of the Logo Designs.</p>
                <p>For the next meeting we created mock-ups.</p>

                <div class="pad">
                    <h1>Mock<span class="greentext">-ups</span></h1>
                </div>

                <div class="row justify-content-center">
                    <div class="col-xs-11 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6"><img src="assets/landing-page.png" class="about-image" alt="WanderOut Landing Page Example"></div>
                    <div class="col-xs-11 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
                        <div class="pad">
                            <p>I was tasked with designing the landing page. The idea that our team thought of was to create an endless scroll page. The header would follow throughout. The first section is a “use case” section. I decided that it would be important to get the user to understand why they would be using this product. Hence the first area is a image use case area. Different images would either scroll or fade in to show the applications of the product.</p>
                            <p> I made sure that the page ends 3/4 of the page. This is a trick used to get the user to want to continue scrolling down. The second section is an interactive section. The product is in the middle with the user having the ability to spin it. Each turn would pop up a new “information section.”</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="pad">
                    <p>The last section of the page is the “buy section.” It features the product on the middle and gives buy options on the side. It has an add to cart button which when pressed opens the cart and shows the product there.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Our team had many discussions as to how to do this properly. We had the idea of the buy button taking you straight to the checkout — however when considering our users we thought that they may not want to go straight to the checkout but look at the product some more. This could actually be a barrier to purchase.</p>

                <div class="pad">
                    <h1>Medium <span class="greentext">Fidelity</span></h1>
                </div>
                <p>After WanderOut approved our mock-ups the next step was medium fidelity mock-ups that we would be able to test with our users in the coming week. This is the landing page that I worked on.</p>
                <img src="assets/landing1.png" class="about-image" alt="WanderOut Landing Page Part 1 Medium Fidelity">

                <div class="pad">
                    <h1>Next <span class="greentext">Steps</span></h1>
                </div>
                <p>After completing this stage of the process - we submitted the layout for approval. We also did some basic testing to get a feel of usability from users. Most things passed the test. Users didn't like the black navigation bar. You can see this change in the next iteration. I was the team member responsible for this page.</p>
